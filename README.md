# CIVE-202---Project-2
NDOT has engaged our firm to transition its current concrete mix design process from Excel to a Python-based system. The goal of this project is to automate the logic contained in the “Mix Design” worksheet so that users can enter material properties and design parameters through a clear step-by-step workflow.
